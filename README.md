<h1>HandTrackingModule</h1>
<h3>Program for hand tracking module.</h3>
I used media pipe here. So you're gonna have to download a lower version of python. Specifically, Python 3.10 or 3.9. 
  
  You're also gonna have to run it on .venv in vscode, that way you can keep your Python 3.13.  
  Don't forget to download all of the necessary libraries, otherwise you'll run into some errors.
